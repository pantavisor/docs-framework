# docs-eval — persona-driven documentation gap evaluation

A pack of reader personas that drive a model through real tasks against the live
Pantavisor docs, reporting exactly where each reader stalls. `RUNBOOK.md` runs a check
and files a report; `AUDITBOOK.md` runs a different kind of check against the same
live site — a repo's published docs against its own `AGENTS.md` rules, not a
simulated reader — and files a report the same way; `FIXBOOK.md` turns one finding
from either report into a draft PR against the repo that actually owns the affected
page.

Both `RUNBOOK.md` and `AUDITBOOK.md` target `https://docs.pantavisor.io/<VERSION>/`
by default `development` (see [Versions](#versions)) and need no local checkout.
Only `FIXBOOK.md` works against a repo checkout — to make the actual edit, and to
confirm the source-level detail the live site can't show (see `AUDITBOOK.md`'s
"What live-site auditing can and can't verify").

## What's here

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `personas/01-yocto-no-containers/` … `12-ai-agent-consumer/` | One folder per persona: `persona.md` (scope + persona card) plus `promptA.md`/`B`/`C`. |
| `RUNBOOK.md` | Runs one persona/prompt pair against the live docs and files the report. |
| `answers/` | One report file per run, under `<NN>-<persona-slug>/`, plus `index.md`. |
| `AUDITBOOK.md` | Checks one repo's `docs/` tree against that repo's own `AGENTS.md` and files the report. |
| `audits/` | One report file per run, under `<repo>/`, plus `index.md`. |
| `FIXBOOK.md` | Turns one finding from an `answers/` or `audits/` report into a draft PR in the owning repo. |
| `rubric.md` | Severity scale, gap taxonomy, report format. Every run reports against this. |
| `ground-truth.md` | Confirmed gaps mapped to the persona that should catch each — the answer key for validating *prompts*, not docs. |

## Check the docs (find gaps)

```bash
claude -p --permission-mode acceptEdits \
  "Follow RUNBOOK.md in the docs-eval repo. persona=01 prompt=A"
```

`--permission-mode acceptEdits` lets the run write its report and commit without
stopping to ask (swap in whatever your setup uses instead). One command = one persona +
one prompt letter; each writes its own file to `answers/<NN>-<slug>/`. A full pass on
one persona is three separate invocations (`prompt=A`, `B`, `C`) — never batched, since
each needs its own cold session (see [Rules](#rules-that-keep-results-meaningful)).

**Personas** — pick a `persona=<NN>`:

| # | Persona | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | Yocto integrator, no containers | Knows BitBake cold, never run `docker run` |
| 02 | Buildroot engineer, no Yocto, no containers | Neither build system the docs assume, nor containers |
| 03 | Cloud-native dev, no embedded | Inverse of 01 — knows OCI, never flashed anything |
| 04 | App developer targeting a Pi | Hard stop at "build an OS" |
| 05 | OTA engineer migrating off Mender/RAUC | Maps everything onto A/B partitions until stopped |
| 06 | BSP bring-up engineer | Wants a work estimate; trusts only serial consoles |
| 07 | Security reviewer | *Undocumented means it doesn't exist* |
| 08 | Adoption evaluator (tech lead) | Optimises for risk and exit cost |
| 09 | Field support operator | Reading at 2am, won't read theory |
| 10 | Git-fluent dev meeting pvr | Will be *confidently wrong* |
| 11 | Manufacturing / provisioning engineer *(extended)* | 40 seconds per unit |
| 12 | AI agent consumer *(extended)* | Can't ask a follow-up, sees the link graph |

**Prompts** — pick a `prompt=<A|B|C>`:

- **A** — Cold-start journey: land at an entry point, stop at the first thing unresolved.
- **B** — Targeted task: one job crossing a repo boundary.
- **C** — Jargon audit: every term used before it's defined.

**Watching progress:** plain `claude -p` prints nothing until the run finishes. Add
`--output-format stream-json --verbose --include-partial-messages` and pipe through
`jq -rj 'select(.type == "stream_event" and .event.delta.type? == "text_delta") | .event.delta.text'`
to watch the text as it's generated.

**Reading results:** findings are tagged S1–S4 (`rubric.md`). S1 = the answer isn't in
the docs at all; S2 = it's there but nothing led the reader to it — those get fixed
differently (writing vs. linking). Watch for the same gap surfacing across personas from
different angles; that's a page that needs to exist, not a one-off.

## Fix a finding (turn an answer into a docs PR)

`docs.pantavisor.io`'s own repo (`docs.pantavisor`) is **not** where fixes go — its
`reference/` content is generated at build time from a release tarball, not committed
source, so a PR there is silently overwritten on the next build. The real source lives
in whichever repo owns the URL path segment:

| URL segment | Repo | Docs live under |
|---|---|---|
| `meta-pantavisor/...` | `github.com/pantavisor/meta-pantavisor` | `docs/` |
| `pantavisor/...` | `github.com/pantavisor/pantavisor` | `docs/` |
| `pvr/...` | `gitlab.com/pantacor/pvr` | `docs/` |

```bash
claude -p --permission-mode acceptEdits \
  "Follow FIXBOOK.md in the docs-eval repo. Fix this finding: \
   answers/01-yocto-no-containers/2026-07-30-promptA-claude-sonnet-5-development.md, \
   the undefined-'trail' row for meta-pantavisor/overview/images"
```

One finding per invocation — same reasoning as one prompt per `RUNBOOK.md` session,
so a fix is reviewable and scoped. `FIXBOOK.md` locates the real source file, re-checks
the gap still exists, makes the minimal edit, and opens a **draft PR** — it never
merges. See `FIXBOOK.md` for the full routing logic and edge cases.

## Audit the docs against their own AGENTS.md

Separate from persona evaluation: `meta-pantavisor` and `pantavisor` each carry an
`AGENTS.md` at their repo root with rules for how their own `docs/` should be
organized (Documentation Structure), whether a feature description gives the reader
something to actually do (Actionability), and how links should be written (Link
Conventions). `AUDITBOOK.md` checks a repo's docs **as published on
`docs.pantavisor.io`** against that repo's *own* `AGENTS.md` — fetched fresh every
run from GitHub, since the two repos' rules are already parallel but not identical,
and either can change independently. Because this runs against the live site, it
can catch real breakage (404s, version drift) but can't verify the literal link
syntax the source used — see `AUDITBOOK.md`'s "What live-site auditing can and
can't verify" for exactly where that line is.

```bash
claude -p --permission-mode acceptEdits \
  "Follow AUDITBOOK.md in the docs-eval repo. repo=meta-pantavisor section=overview"
```

One command = one repo + one optional version/section scope (defaults to
`version=development` — "master" in this pack's terms, since the site has no
literal `/master/` path); each writes its report to `audits/<repo>/`. Findings
from an audit feed into the same `FIXBOOK.md` draft-PR flow as a persona
finding — see `CLAUDE.md`'s "Applying a fix" section, which accepts either
report type. Suggested cadence is much lower than persona runs (`AGENTS.md`
rules change rarely) — monthly per repo is a reasonable start.

This never blocks anything — same model as the rest of this pack. A CI check that
actually fails a PR on a Link Conventions violation would be a separate, follow-on
piece of work living in the target repo's own `.github/workflows/`, not here.

## Versions

Every persona/prompt uses a `{VERSION}` placeholder, resolved to `development` unless
told otherwise. Append `version=stable` (or an RC tag like `029-rc4`) to a `RUNBOOK.md`
invocation to target a different published version. `development` is the version this
pack's `ground-truth.md` was verified against; a gap on another version may just be that
version lagging behind, not a fresh defect — treat non-default runs as a separate,
deliberate audit rather than folding them into a regular check cadence.

## Rules that keep results meaningful

- **Fresh session per persona, one prompt per session.** Context bleed destroys the
  knowledge boundary a persona depends on — `RUNBOOK.md`/`claude -p` invocations do this
  automatically; don't paste multiple personas or prompts into one manual session.
- **Docs-only scope.** A report citing anything outside `https://docs.pantavisor.io/<VERSION>/`
  means the fence leaked — discard the run.
- **Prefer each page's `.md` export** (`<page-url>.md`, same as the site's "Copy page"
  button) over the rendered HTML — cleaner to quote, and it's what this pack's
  `unlinked`/`broken-path` findings are verified against.
- **Never fetch `/llms.txt`** or similar site-wide AI summaries, even though they're on
  `docs.pantavisor.io` — they hand a persona the exact conclusions this pack exists to
  test whether the docs themselves get across.

## Maintaining the pack

When a run surfaces a new, real gap, verify it and add it to `ground-truth.md`. When a
persona misses a gap that's seeded in its own lane, fix the *prompt*, not the docs —
that inversion is the whole point of `ground-truth.md`. When a gap gets fixed, move it
to Resolved there rather than deleting the row.
